                        <h1>Top 10 Tips for Small Business Websites to Stand Out</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>July 16, Jack Krieps</h4>
                        <h3>When it comes to small businesses, a great website that provides a very user-friendly experience is one of the most essential ways to develop. Competition for user attention is growing at a constant rate as companies are taking advantage of the new ways to market and share ideas online. A business may have strong search engine optimization to help draw in customers, but if they are not interested in the website, they are not going to stay. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to make your site unique and memorable while also engaging potential clients:</h3>
                        <h2>1) Take a unique stand</h2>
                        <h3>It is important to create content that takes a unique stand on topics that resonate with your target audience. It doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be a controversial topic, but it should offer information that cannot be found elsewhere. Unique points of view and opinions on important topics with lots of supporting information tend to have higher viewerships and engagement rates.</h3>
                        <h2>2) Show the world who you are through creative bios</h2>
                        <h3>Your prospective clients want to know who they would potentially be working with. Because of this, it is essential to get creative when writing employee bios. Whether it is telling a story, listing hobbies, linking a Spotify playlist, or showing an image with some personality, the bios should show the world what makes each employee unique.</h3>
                        <h2></h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="cardrow">
                    <div class="cardimg nocover maxwidth" style="background-image: url(/media/images/insights/071620-SmallBusinessWebsiteBios.png)">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="cardrow">
                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h2>3) Provide insight and inspiration</h2>
                        <h3>It is always a good idea to establish mantras for your business through your website. This helps people understand the company values and builds a culture of like-minded individuals. Many businesses who have done this found including a monthly mantra to be very effective. Furthermore, blog posts can be written to provide more insight which inspires prospective clients and makes them want to work with your business.</h3>
                        <h2>4) Showcase likeable and relatable video</h2>
                        <h3>A quick introduction video is a great way to instantly differentiate your website and catch a prospective clientâ€™s attention. This has proven to be effective by numerous businesses because it provides a very user-friendly experience. It also gives personality to your brand, making your business instantly relatable and likable to prospects.</h3>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h2>5) Donâ€™t use stock photos</h2>
                        <h3>Ditch stock photos in order to capture the real essence of your business. These are a very plain and ordinary way to introduce your business, and many organizations do not take the time to publish content that is indicative of their actual nature. Your website imagery should be full of your actual employees because clients value authenticity.</h3>
                        <h2>6) Keep your website content fresh</h2>
                        <h3>One of the best ways to engage with prospective clients is to keep your website current. This resource is the ideal place to showcase your best and most recent work which reflects creative capabilities and problem-solving skills. To be even more direct, you can host a blog with thought pieces from colleagues on relevant industry issues.</h3>
                        <h2>7) Display examples and metrics</h2>
                        <h3>Always provide potential clients with work you have done and what the results have been. The more specific and direct you are, the quicker you can figure out what the client is looking for and devise a creative way to achieve that goal for them.</h3>
                        <h2>8) Offer a free, personalized report</h2>
                        <h3>Small business websites that offer a free report as a personalized takeaway item differentiate themselves due to the better online experience that delivers value to prospective customers. The important part is figuring out what report your business can offer, and how it can be customized to fit the prospectâ€™s needs.</h3>
                        <h2>9) Adjust your website menus and navigation titles</h2>
                        <h3>There has been a trend in website navigation pages being given unique titles for companies breaking out of the mold in their industries. These small changes can help your prospective customers understand the value your brand offers. Simply changing one word while navigating through your businessâ€™s website will let users really see the value proposition you are providing.</h3>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h2>10) Make it about them</h2>
                        <h3>Probably one of the most important pieces of advice is to make your businessâ€™s website about the clients and customers. Communicate the values of your products or services in ways that will resonate with them. You can do this by providing case studies, success stories, and examples of how you have helped solve their problems. Avoid the natural tendency to make the website completely about yourself.</h3>
                        <h3>In conclusion, there are endless ways to make your businesses website stand out from the competition. Begin by implementing these tips, and you will soon find out what works and what does not. Just remember, if you were a prospective customer, how would you want a website to look?</h3>
